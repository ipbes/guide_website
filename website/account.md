An account can be created by visiting [https://www.ipbes.net/user/register](https://www.ipbes.net/user/register) and entering required information. The following information is requested at the time of registration: username, email address, salutation, first name, middle name, last name, job title, affiliation, about, mailing list subscription, and security question. Once accounts are created, users can login to provide additional information. Account verification can take up to 24-48 hours.

All registered users have a user dashboard which can be accessed after logging in by clicking on your username at the top right or by typing /user at the end of the site’s URL i.e. [https://www.ipbes.net/user](https://www.ipbes.net/user). Once you’ve accessed the login page, you can log in with your account information. We suggest bookmarking the page for quick access. The user dashboard will contain the name, photo and biography of the user. It will also contain all the IPBES roles assigned to the user, groups, form submissions and Policy Support content created by the user.

When you’re done adding and editing content on the site, you’ll want to make sure you log out to avoid security risks. You can log out from anywhere on the site by using either of the buttons shown in the picture below. Once you log out, you’ll be taken back to the Home page of the site.


• If you ever forget your password, you can have a new one-time login password emailed to you. Use it to log in and then re-set your password immediately. Note:
it is very important that you are not already logged in or you will be prompted for your old password which you do not have. So when using this one-time log in do not do anything else on the site before setting your password.
• To logout use the logout button in the login block (top of the sidebar on each page) or go to “my account” in the toolbox, and click “logout”. Alternately, go http://websitename/logout
