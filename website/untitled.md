## About

The Policy Support Portal is a toolkit of approaches, techniques, and good practices, that enables access to:

* The Catalogue of policy support tools and methodologies, containing policy support tools and policy instruments linked to assessments, case studies, learning opportunities, and communities of practice.
* The Methodological guidance developed by IPBES, currently including guidance on using scenarios and models, and on the diverse conceptualisation of values. Links to relevant policy support tools and instruments are included.

## Add Content to the Catalogue

In order to add content to the Catalogue of Policy Support Tools and Methodologies you need to be signed in with your IPBES account. If you are registered, please log in and read the information below. If you are not registered, please register here.

Then, you should decide whether your resource is relevant to IPBES work and if so, under which section of the Catalogue it falls. Your resource should have the potential to support policy formulation and implementation in relation to biodiversity and ecosystems.

Since case studies provide examples relating to the practical application of policy support tools or instruments, it is strongly encouraged to have a variety of case studies for each of those. To the extent possible, please do bear this in mind when selecting the material to upload.

## Approval process

When you have created content it will appear in a tab on your IPBES website user account page. Content that has been submitted will be reviewed by Technical Support Unit and published.
