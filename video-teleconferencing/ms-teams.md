   * Or go to **Calendar** ![Meetings button](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/f788fe72-7168-45df-98c8-58ceac0a9aac.png) on the left side of the app and either select **New meeting** at the top right of the app, or select a range of time in your calendar and it will pop open a scheduling form.

   Similar to Outlook, in the scheduling form is where you'll give a title to your meeting, invite people, and add meetings details.

   On the right side of the scheduling form you will have the option to add a channel, individual people, or leave both blank to book yourself an appointment.
