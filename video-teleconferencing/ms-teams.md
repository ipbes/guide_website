## **Participate in a meeting**

### Join a meeting

You can join Teams meetings anytime, anywhere, from any device.

#### Join by link

All you need to join a Teams meeting is a link.

![A hyperlink with text reading &quot;Join Microsoft Teams Meeting&quot;](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/b2df7d93-82d7-462b-8dea-ef80fecbdc80.png)

When you open the link or select **Join Microsoft Teams Meeting** in your meeting invite, you’ll be directed to a page where you can choose to either join on the web or download the desktop app and then join. If you already have the Teams app, the meeting will open there automatically.

If you don’t have a Teams account and the organizer has allowed it, you may have the option to enter your name to join the meeting as a guest. If you do have a Teams account, select **Sign in** to join with access to the meeting chat and more. Then, depending on the organizer’s settings, you may join the meeting right away or go to the lobby where people in the meeting can admit you.

#### Join by phone

Even if you don’t have internet access or the Teams app, you can join some meetings by phone. If it has a phone number and conference ID in the meeting invite, just dial to join.

#### Add a room while you join

When you’re choosing your audio and video settings, you have the option to add a room so you can use a meeting room’s audio and video devices. Your personal device may even detect a nearby room using Bluetooth. If it does, you’ll see the meeting room’s name and the option to **Join and add this room**. If the nearby room has already joined the meeting, you can **Join with audio off** to avoid disrupting the meeting.

![On the join screen, Other join options has a pop-up that Team Room Redmond is nearby with the option to Join and add this room](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/8e93c15b-3c73-43ac-a51b-fe793e4053ce.png)

If your device doesn’t detect the room nearby, select **Add a room** under **Other join options** and search for the room you’re using.

### Join a meeting without a Teams account

You can join a Teams meeting anytime, from any device, whether or not you have a Teams account. If you don't have an account, follow these steps to join as a guest. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** Some meetings don't allow people to join as guests. 
{% endhint %}

Go to the meeting invite and select **Join Microsoft Teams Meeting**.

1. That'll open a webpage, where you'll see two choices: **Download the Windows app** and **Join on the web instead**. If you join on the web, you can use either Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome. Your browser may ask if it's OK for Teams to use your mic and camera. Be sure to allow it so you'll be seen and heard in your meeting.
2. Enter your name and choose your audio and video settings. If the meeting room \(or another device that's connected to the meeting\) is nearby, choose **Audio off** to avoid disrupting. Select **Phone audio** if you want to listen to the meeting on your mobile phone.
3. When you're ready, hit **Join now**.
4. This will bring you into the lobby. We'll notify the meeting organizer that you're there, and someone in the meeting can then admit you.
