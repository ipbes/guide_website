## Teams and Channels

_A team_ is a collection of people, conversations, files, and tools — all in one place. _A channel_ is a discussion in a team, dedicated to a department, project, or topic.

Channels are where the work actually gets done—where [text, audio, and video conversations](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/meetings-in-teams-e0b0ae21-53ee-4462-a50d-ca9b9e217b67) open to the whole team happen, where [files are shared](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/share-a-file-in-teams-0c4d34ee-5dd8-46d5-ab35-0d227b5e6eb5), and where [apps are added](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/add-an-app-to-teams-b2217706-f7ed-4e64-8e96-c413afd02f77).

### **Pick a team and channel**

   If you're not on a team and want to create one.

7. When you're done adding members, select **Add** and then **Close**.
