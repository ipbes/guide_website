## Teams and Channels

_A team_ is a collection of people, conversations, files, and tools — all in one place. _A channel_ is a discussion in a team, dedicated to a department, project, or topic.

Channels are where the work actually gets done—where [text, audio, and video conversations](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/meetings-in-teams-e0b0ae21-53ee-4462-a50d-ca9b9e217b67) open to the whole team happen, where [files are shared](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/share-a-file-in-teams-0c4d34ee-5dd8-46d5-ab35-0d227b5e6eb5), and where [apps are added](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/add-an-app-to-teams-b2217706-f7ed-4e64-8e96-c413afd02f77).

### **Pick a team and channel**

1. Select **Teams** ![Teams button](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/20305b5c-df47-4154-a21a-b12712c4224c.png) on the left side of the app and then pick a team.

   If you're not on a team and want to create one.

2. Select a channel and explore the **Conversations**, **Files**, and other tabs.

### Create a team

1. Select **Teams** &gt; **Join or create a team**.

   This is where you create your own team, or discover existing ones.

2. Select **Create a new team**, and then select **Build a team from scratch** or select **Create from...** to build an all-new team or create from an existing group respectively.
3. Select **Private** if you'd like people to request permission to join, or select **Public** if anyone in your org can join.
4. Give the team a name and add a short description if you'd like.
5. Select **Create**.
6. Add members.
   * You can add people, groups, or even entire contact groups.
   * If you need to add people from outside the organisation, use their email address to invite them as guests. Add a friendly display name for them too.
7. When you're done adding members, select **Add** and then **Close**.

### Create channel for the team

By default, every team gets a **General** channel, which is a good channel to use for announcements and information the whole team needs. To add more channels:

1. Select ![Select to see more options](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/c895c3f1-9e3a-451d-9f7c-4be804303b3a.png) **More options...** next to the team name.
2. Select **Add channel**.
3. Enter a name and description for your channel.

   You can build a channel around a topic, project, department name, or whatever you like.

## Chat

### Start Chat

You start one-on-one and group chats the same way: by selecting **New chat** ![New chat icon](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/50177cc7-a47b-41dd-b1a3-f0ba94ed9125.png) at the top of your chat list.

#### Start a one-on-one chat

Once you've selected **New chat** ![New chat icon in Teams](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/d7854e6f-cba6-4045-8820-2a07130394d0.png) and entered the person’s name, compose your message in the box at the bottom of the chat. To open your [formatting options](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/format-a-message-in-teams-9f7c64e4-0316-472f-b1e8-430cebcfc1e5), select **Format**  ![Expand button](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/39818b5e-d559-4213-968c-2f6ac0180f16.png) beneath the box where you type your message.

![Select Format to expand the box.](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/4061a793-312b-44be-8565-2d7f68baaf49.png)

When you're ready, select Send ![Send a message icon.](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/02edfc47-f927-48d8-bd7b-dc684e20e1f4.png) . This starts the chat.

You can also start a one-on-one chat from someone's profile card. Open it by clicking their picture in a channel or from a search.

#### Start and name a group chat

Start one the same way you start a one-on-one chat: select **New chat** ![New chat icon in Teams](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/97898dea-2d79-422f-ac6c-17f78f837f60.png) at the top of your chat list. Select the down arrow to the far right of the **To** field and type a name for the chat in the **Group name** field. Then, type the names of the people you’d like to add in the **To** field.

![Name a group chat in Teams.](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/2b1e7f6c-2d49-43ef-aa53-b2074c4fbb5d.png)

This starts a new conversation. Everyone who has access to the group chat can [send messages](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/send-and-read-messages-in-teams-b29e60ec-76af-4d97-8c3c-a4e36f2b64aa).

You can include up to 100 people in a group chat. 

#### Add people to the conversation

To loop more people into the conversation, just click **Add people** ![Add people to team button](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/c84aa0b9-6f19-40ba-8e5d-53df1b072cb9.png) \(or **View and add participants** in group chat\) in the top right corner of Teams. Then, type the names of the people you'd like to chat with, select how much of the chat history to include, and click **Add**. 

**Note:** When adding someone to a group chat \(not a one-on-one\), you can include the chat history. 

![Chat history in Teams](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/2f0b0e65-1e64-4a9e-89cd-39e4f691ea2b.png)

Teams will save the whole chat history, all the way back to the first message. And if someone [leaves the group](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/leave-or-remove-someone-from-a-group-chat-7db55a67-0ba4-4409-a399-5ed502a1d094), their chat responses are still there in your chat history.

#### See who's in a group chat

To see who’s in a group chat, hover over the number of participants in the chat header to show a list of everyone’s names.
